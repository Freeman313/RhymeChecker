# RhymeChecker

## Issues
The program currently just scans the word to see if the first syllable rhymes
with anything and then it matches that with other first syllables of words. 
It also has troubles with conjugations (i.e folks doesn't rhyme with joke)

## Todo
Add the ability to match and color individual syllables
Add the ability to specify input verse text file
add ability to export image
make window resize based on length of line and verse
