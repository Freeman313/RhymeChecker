I play hard for nine innings, dressed in fine linen
‘Cause pussy is the best next thing besides winnin'
All the positions I've been in couldn't explain how I'm livin'
My vision, my intuition has risen
Here, take a listen, I'm hittin'
Up to bat with precision; see, I'm back in the kitchen
Slinging crack to these pigeons, for the fact that I'm driven
My linebackers is blitzin', send you packing, good riddance
Trapped in this prison where snakes and rats is forbidden
Keep my gun hitting, niggas is bitches signing petitions
And they providing convictions
See, I survive through the system under the livest conditions
My riders ride on a mission
For snitchin', you get your back blown right out of commission
You'll be missin' like them crazy Christians
And swimming with all the fishes
Your Ms.'s will come and witness your body with hugs and kisses
Now, tell me, is that nutritious?
We party with chips and liquors
Your wizzes is coming with us
For real, kid, they bought me presents
The difference is this is business, big biscuits, big figures
We click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious
Move, ‘cause the Coupe is vicious
Shoot if you want your wishes to blow
See Trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches
